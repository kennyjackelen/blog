blog
====
I use wordpress to run a blog where I share my photos with friends and
family.

This is the source for my wordpress setup (minus wp-config.php, of course).
I like to test upgrades from wordpress and other code changes I make to my
blog on a test server and then easily deploy them to my production server
via this repository.
